nefarious was made possible thanks to:

- `Guido van Rossum`_: for making python_
- `Dave Coffin`_: for making dcraw_, which helped me a lot to understand the nef structure
- The `Python Imaging Library`_: which got me started with tiff parsing, many of the tag constants and tiff headers in nefarious comes straight from PIL.
- `Ali-Akber Saifee`_: my python mentor, which became involved a lot more than he anticipated in making nefarious presentable :p
