nefarious is made by me, *Timoth√©e Groleau*, for my own usage. I have no doubt that such an awesome, open source utility will soon attract hords of eager contributors ;)

nefarious is made in python as a way for me to learn python through a real program. I am in great debt to my friend and colleague Ali-Akber Saifee who made nefarious a lot more presentable before you had a chance to look at it.

I am normally pretty opened minded and thick-skinned, but if you spot some wtf moments while looking at the code, please stay polite is letting me know, you wouldn't want to hurt my feelings now, would you?
